<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Epoxy Flooring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dissipative Type</li><li>Conductive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-static epoxy flooring is categorized into dissipative type and conductive type markets. Dissipative type flooring reduces the buildup of static electricity by gradually dissipating the charge. These floors are suitable for areas where static-sensitive equipment is used. Conductive type flooring quickly disperses static electricity to ground, making it ideal for environments with a higher risk of electrostatic discharge. Both types of flooring provide effective static control to protect sensitive equipment and ensure a safe working environment.</p></p>
