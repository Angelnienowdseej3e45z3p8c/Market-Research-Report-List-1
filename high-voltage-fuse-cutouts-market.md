<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Voltage Fuse Cutouts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cutout With Single Hinge</li><li>Cutout With Double Hinge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High voltage fuse cutouts are available in two main types: cutouts with single hinge and cutouts with double hinge. Cutouts with single hinge have a simpler design with one pivot point for the fuse tube to swing open. On the other hand, cutouts with double hinge have two pivot points for increased stability and strength when opening the fuse tube. Both types of cutouts play a critical role in the protection of high voltage electrical systems by safely interrupting power flow in case of an overload or fault.</p></p>
