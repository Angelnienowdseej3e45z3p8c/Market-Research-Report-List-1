<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Railway Sintered Frictional Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brake Pad</li><li>Brake Shoe</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Railway sintered frictional material market has three main types: brake pad, brake shoe, and other. Brake pads are fitted inside the brake calipers to create friction against the brake rotor, slowing down the train. Brake shoes are used in older train models where the brake pad is pressed against the inside surface of the wheel to slow down or stop the train. The "other" category may include various sintered frictional materials used in different components of the railway braking system.</p></p>
