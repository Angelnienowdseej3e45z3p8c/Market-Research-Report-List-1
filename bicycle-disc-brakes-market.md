<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bicycle Disc Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Disc Brakes</li><li>Hydraulic Disc Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bicycle disc brakes are classified into two main types: mechanical disc brakes and hydraulic disc brakes. Mechanical disc brakes use a cable to transmit pressure from the brake lever to the caliper, while hydraulic disc brakes use hydraulic fluid to transfer pressure, providing more efficient and powerful braking performance. Hydraulic disc brakes are generally preferred for their superior stopping power and modulation, making them popular among professional cyclists and enthusiasts. Meanwhile, mechanical disc brakes are more cost-effective and easier to maintain, making them a popular choice for casual riders.</p></p>
