<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Sheet Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unilateral Contact</li><li>No Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Double Sheet Sensor market includes two main types: Unilateral Contact and No Contact. Unilateral Contact sensors detect double sheets by physically contacting the material, providing accurate and reliable detection. No Contact sensors, on the other hand, use non-contact methods such as ultrasonic or optical technology to detect double sheets without physically touching the material. Each type offers its own advantages depending on the specific application requirements, with Unilateral Contact sensors being ideal for more precise measurements and No Contact sensors offering non-intrusive detection.</p></p>
