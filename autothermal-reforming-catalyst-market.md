<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autothermal Reforming Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated</li><li>Non-Activated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Autothermal reforming catalysts can be classified into two types â€“ activated and non-activated. Activated catalysts are those that have undergone a treatment process to enhance their catalytic activity and efficiency in converting hydrocarbons into hydrogen. Non-activated catalysts do not undergo any treatment and are used as is. Both types of catalysts play a crucial role in the autothermal reforming process by facilitating the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons through a balanced combination of oxidation and steam reforming reactions.</p></p>
