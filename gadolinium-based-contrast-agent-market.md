<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gadolinium-based Contrast Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear non-ionic agent</li><li>Linear ionic</li><li>Macrocyclic non-ionic</li><li>Macrocyclic ionic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear non-ionic agents are the most commonly used gadolinium-based contrast agents in MRI imaging due to their low toxicity and stability. Linear ionic agents have a higher ionic charge which can increase the risk of adverse reactions in some patients. Macrocyclic non-ionic agents have a more stable molecular structure and are less likely to release free gadolinium ions in the body. Macrocyclic ionic agents have a higher stability and lower toxicity compared to linear agents, making them a preferred choice for patients with compromised kidney function.</p></p>
