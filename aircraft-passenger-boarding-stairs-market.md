<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Passenger Boarding Stairs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Towered</li><li>Self-Propelled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft passenger boarding stairs come in two main types - towered and self-propelled. Towered boarding stairs are controlled by ground personnel who position and operate the stairs to allow passengers to board the aircraft. On the other hand, self-propelled boarding stairs are operated by the driver themselves, allowing for more flexibility and control during the boarding process. Both types of boarding stairs serve the same purpose of providing safe and efficient access for passengers to board and disembark from the aircraft.</p></p>
