<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Masterbatches Anti-Static Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Migratory Antistats</li><li>Non-Migratory Antistats</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Masterbatches Anti-Static market includes two main types - Migratory Antistats and Non-Migratory Antistats. Migratory Antistats are added to the polymer during processing and migrate to the surface to provide anti-static properties. Non-Migratory Antistats, on the other hand, are evenly dispersed within the polymer and do not migrate, providing long-lasting anti-static effects. Both types of anti-static masterbatches are used in various industries such as packaging, electronics, and automotive to prevent the build-up of static electricity.</p></p>
